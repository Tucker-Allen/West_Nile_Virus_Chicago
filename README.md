# Predicting West Nile Virus in Chicago

See presentation slides for this project here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pVu9Kny96oMBPrE9BkOLjfOUPx0yyCS4yAWY9dCz_xw/edit?usp=sharing

This project was based on a competition hosted on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus) 

This git repository was relocated from my Git Enterprise at the conclusion of the project, and will therefore have an incomplete git history.

See the README.md within the 'input' directory for more information.
